"""The gold gate (spec §4.4, §4.5): a judgement over a gold run, not a second run loop.

``gold_gate`` runs ``run_suite`` in gold mode - no model, no provider, no network - and passes
when all three hold:

1. every *valid* reference executes and self-matches under ``rows_equal_v2`` (a gold row that
   is neither ``correct`` nor ``reference_invalid`` is a comparator that disagrees with itself);
2. every ``reference_invalid`` ID is on the suite's reviewed exception list
   (``evaluation/suites/<suite>.gold_exceptions.txt``);
3. every non-answerable case is well-formed: no gold SQL, and an ``expected`` whose correct
   outcome the pipeline can actually produce.

Headline EX and reference coverage are reported either way, so an excepted reference lowers
the headline (nine valid plus one excepted is a passing gate at 9/10) without failing the gate.
Two populations are kept apart: a suite whose answerable cases all have invalid references
reports headline ``0/N`` and conditional ``0/0 (undefined)``; a suite with no answerable cases
at all (``safety``) reports EX *not applicable* and rests on check 3 alone. Safety accuracy is a
model metric, so the gate never reports it (``metric_cells(..., gold=True)``).
