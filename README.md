## What It Does

The app lets a user connect a local SQLite database or upload CSV files, ask a plain-English question, and receive a table of results. The LLM only receives schema metadata, not raw database rows.

The current branch supports two LLM backends:

- Gemini API, using `GEMINI_API_KEY` or a multi-key failover set
- Local Ollama, using a model such as `gemma3`

## Architecture

1. Python extracts SQLite `CREATE TABLE` statements.
2. Schema RAG builds table-level chunks from DDL, columns, and foreign-key relationships.
3. The most relevant schema chunks are retrieved for the user question using hybrid lexical, semantic, and foreign-key graph signals.
4. The user question and retrieved schema are sent to the selected LLM.
5. The LLM returns one SQLite `SELECT` query.
6. Python validates that the SQL is read-only and avoids SQLite internals.
7. SQLite executes the query locally in read-only mode.
8. Streamlit renders the result table, with an automatic bar chart when the result is a two-column `GROUP BY`-shaped answer (one category column, one numeric column).

![Runtime architecture schematic: request trace builds context left to right, response trace validates, executes, and answers right to left, with optional key-failover, repair, and auto-chart branches](docs/screenshots/00-architecture-workflow.png)

For a deeper, multi-page diagram (hybrid RAG internals, the offline evaluation workflow, and a module map), see `docs/diagrams/architecture.drawio` and `docs/2_architecture.md`.

## Schema RAG

The project includes an advanced local schema RAG layer. It does not read or embed row data. It only indexes:

- table names
- column names
- `CREATE TABLE` DDL
- foreign-key neighbor tables
- low-cardinality text value hints, such as status or grade categories

At question time, the backend:

1. tokenizes the user question
2. expands common business synonyms such as `client -> customer` and `revenue -> amount/sales`
3. scores schema chunks with a BM25-style lexical ranking
4. adds local hashed embedding similarity and character n-gram semantic similarity for fuzzy matching
5. adds privacy-safe categorical value hints for low-cardinality text columns
6. decomposes the question into entities, aggregations, filters, and comparisons for explainability
7. adds stronger boosts for exact table and column matches
8. expands through foreign-key neighbors so joinable tables are included
9. sends only the selected schema snippets to the LLM

This improves:

- prompt size for larger databases
- latency and cost
- table selection accuracy
- privacy, because only metadata is retrieved
- explainability, because selected tables, value hints, prompt savings, and schema recall are reported

In the Streamlit sidebar you can toggle schema RAG and adjust how many tables are retrieved. Each answer also includes an optional retrieval report showing selected tables, scores, matched terms, and graph-expansion reasons.

## Safety Model

- Generated SQL must start with `SELECT` or `WITH`.
- Data modification and schema-changing statements are blocked.
- Internal SQLite tables such as `sqlite_master` are blocked.
- SQL is parsed with `sqlglot` when available for AST-level read-only validation.
- SQLite is opened in read-only URI mode.
- `PRAGMA query_only = ON` is enabled during execution.
- A SQLite authorizer denies writes, DDL, transactions, attach/detach, pragmas, analyze, and reindex.
- Results are capped to avoid rendering unexpectedly large outputs.
- If safe generated SQL fails during execution, the system can make one LLM-based repair attempt using the SQLite error message.

## Inspiration From Text-to-SQL Research and BI Practice

The Holistics article ["Why is Text-to-SQL so hard?"](https://www.holistics.io/blog/text-to-sql/) argues that reliable Text-to-SQL is difficult because natural language is ambiguous, enterprise schemas are complex, and SQL is a strict execution language. It highlights semantic layers as a way to ground AI systems in governed business concepts, relationships, and metric definitions instead of asking a model to guess from raw table names.

Our prototype applies the same idea at assignment scale:

- The schema/RAG layer acts as a lightweight semantic layer over SQLite.
- Hybrid retrieval selects relevant tables, columns, foreign-key relationships, and safe categorical hints.
- The generated SQL is shown to users for verification.
- SQL execution is governed through read-only validation and local execution.

Unlike a full BI semantic layer such as Holistics AQL, our tool still generates SQL directly. The trade-off is that our prototype is simpler and flexible for arbitrary SQLite databases, but less governed than a production semantic-layer system with centrally defined metrics.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Gemini, create `.env` in the project root:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
TEXT_TO_SQL_PROVIDER=gemini
```

For Gemini quota failover, provide multiple keys either as a comma-separated list:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEYS=key_1,key_2,key_3
TEXT_TO_SQL_PROVIDER=gemini
```

or as indexed variables:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=key_0
GOOGLE_API_KEY_1=key_1
GOOGLE_API_KEY_2=key_2
TEXT_TO_SQL_PROVIDER=gemini
```

The Gemini manager rotates to the next key on `429` quota errors and `492` errors. On `503`, it retries the current key once before advancing. This runs in the shared LLM layer, so the Streamlit app, notebooks, and evaluation script all use the same failover behavior.

For local Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3
ollama serve
```

Then select `ollama` in the Streamlit sidebar.

### Reading tables outside the default schema

DuckDB and PostgreSQL group tables into schemas. By default this agent reads
**only** the connection's default schemas — `main` for DuckDB; for PostgreSQL,
every schema on the connecting role's effective `search_path` (normally just
`public`, or `aipa_ro, public` if a schema named after the role exists) — so a
schema's table names, columns and DDL are never sent to the LLM provider just
because the connecting role happens to be able to read them. On PostgreSQL a
bare table name means exactly what it would mean in `psql` as that role: the
first search-path schema holding that name wins, and a table it shadows is
shown and accepted only under its `schema.table` spelling. To include schemas
outside the default ones, list them in `TEXT_TO_SQL_EXTRA_SCHEMAS`, comma-separated:

```bash
TEXT_TO_SQL_EXTRA_SCHEMAS=analytics,reporting
```

On PostgreSQL this is one of two gates: a named schema is still only read if
the connecting role actually holds `has_schema_privilege` on it. On DuckDB it
is the only gate, since opening the file grants access to every schema in it.
Either way, `pg_catalog`, `information_schema` and any other internal schema
are refused however they are named.

**If you point the agent at a database whose tables live outside the default
schema and do not set this, the schema comes back empty and every question
answers `UNANSWERABLE_WITH_GIVEN_SCHEMA`** — there is nothing wrong with the
connection, the tables are simply out of scope. That is the symptom to
recognise: check `TEXT_TO_SQL_EXTRA_SCHEMAS` first. Set once per deployment, read
once per engine instance, and included in the schema cache key, so changing it
re-reads the catalogue rather than serving a stale scope. See
`docs/3_decisions.md`'s "schema scope is opt-in, via `TEXT_TO_SQL_EXTRA_SCHEMAS`"
entry for what else was considered, and its 2026-09-27 "the search path is
PostgreSQL's default" entry for why PostgreSQL's default is the whole path.

PostgreSQL queries run with `search_path` pinned to `pg_catalog`, so the agent
schema-qualifies each table itself before running it; the SQL shown beside a
result is that qualified text (`SELECT name FROM "public".customers`), because
it is what actually ran. One consequence to know about: operators an extension
installed on the search path are not used, so `pg_trgm`'s `%` fails with
"operator does not exist". A query that touches a column whose type carries
casts or operators of its own outside `pg_catalog` - `citext`, or a custom
type with a user-defined cast - is refused with
`BLOCKED_UNSUPPORTED_COLUMN_TYPE` rather than run, because under the pin such
a query can either run user code or (for `citext`) silently compare
case-sensitively. Plain enums and domains over built-in types are unaffected.
See `docs/3_decisions.md`'s 2026-09-27 entries.

## Run The App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

In the sidebar you can:

- choose Gemini or Ollama
- set the model name
- enable or disable schema RAG
- tune how many schema tables are retrieved
- use an existing `.db` path
- upload a SQLite `.db`
- upload one or more CSV files
- create the built-in university demo database

## Create Demo Data

```bash
python -c "import text_to_sql_agent as a; a.write_university_db('data/university_agent.db')"
```

## Run Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Running the PostgreSQL tests

`text_to_sql_agent/engines/postgres.py` is the third `Engine` implementation
(alongside SQLite and DuckDB). Its tests, and the PostgreSQL third of the
engine conformance suite, need a real server and are skipped by default:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/postgres.yml up -d
export TEXT_TO_SQL_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN=postgresql://aipa_ro:aipa_ro_pw@127.0.0.1:55432/aipa
uv sync --extra engines
uv run pytest
uv run pytest -m conformance -rs   # 36 passed, 0 skipped, with the DSN set
```

`docker/postgres.yml` provisions `aipa_ro`, a least-privilege role with no
write or DDL grants, and the same `customers`/`sales` fixtures the tests
pin — connect as `aipa_ro`, not the compose file's `postgres` superuser
account: `PostgresEngine.check_reachable()` deliberately refuses a superuser
DSN (see `docs/3_decisions.md`). Without `TEXT_TO_SQL_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN` set (or
without Docker running), `uv run pytest` still passes; it just skips the
PostgreSQL-only tests, printing why each one skipped with `-rs`. CI runs
these tests against a `postgres:16` service container and fails the build if
any conformance test is skipped, so a contributor without Docker still gets
full coverage on push.

## Run Evaluation

The evaluation harness compares generated SQL results with gold SQL results.
Use `gold` mode first to verify that the benchmark and databases are healthy:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode gold
```

Then run an LLM evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider ollama --model gemma3
```

Outputs are written to `evaluation/results/` as CSV and Markdown summaries.

**The v2 harness** (`scripts/evaluate_v2.py`) is the current one. It writes one
directory per run with `manifest.json`, `cases.csv` and `report.md`, refuses to
overwrite a finished run, and resumes an interrupted one:

```bash
uv run python scripts/prepare_benchmarks.py --suite spider_dev bird_dev   # downloads, hash-verified
uv run python scripts/evaluate_v2.py --gate gold --suite demo safety     # the CI gate
uv run python scripts/evaluate_v2.py --suite demo --mode llm --provider ollama --model qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M
uv run python scripts/evaluate_v2.py --suite bird_dev --subset subset200 --evidence on \
    --mode llm --provider ollama --model qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M --work-limit 1000000000 --max-rows 100000
uv run python scripts/evaluate_v2.py --gate regression --new <run dir> --baseline <run dir>
```

Public suites require the explicit budget shown. Ollama model runs send
`think: false` unless `--ollama-think on` or `--ollama-think default` says
otherwise, and the setting is recorded in the run's identity and directory
name. The v1 commands below still work and produce the historical-format files.

For Gemini free-tier testing with the v1 script, use a throttle or a smaller smoke test:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --delay-seconds 15
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --max-cases 3
python scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --max-cases 3 --max-retries 2 --retry-base-seconds 30 --resume
```

## Evaluation Results

### v2 results — 2026-10-10, commit `7708295`

Measured under the frozen evaluation contract v2
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-evaluation-contract-v2-design.md`): typed
result comparison, a separate safety metric, bootstrap 95 % intervals over
cases, and a manifest per run recording the commit, suite and database hashes,
prompt hash, model and settings. Model: Ollama `qwen3.5:9b-q4_K_M` with
thinking off, schema RAG on (`k=6`). Every run below is `complete` and citable.
**These numbers are not comparable to the May tables further down**: the
model, the pipeline and the scoring rules all differ.

| Suite | Cases | Thinking off (current) | Thinking at the model's default (2026-10-09) |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `demo` (3 demo databases) | 12 | EX **33.3%** [8.3, 58.3] (4/12), [run](evaluation/results/2026-10-10T061821_demo_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off-think-off_b3215300_55cb/report.md) | EX 41.7% [16.7, 66.7] (5/12), [run](evaluation/results/2026-10-09T052607_demo_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off_bdbb6f00_5980/report.md) |
| `safety` (refusals and unanswerables) | 15 | safety accuracy **73.3%** [53.3, 93.3] (11/15), [run](evaluation/results/2026-10-10T061911_safety_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off-think-off_d4425037_0a6d/report.md) | safety accuracy 80.0% [60.0, 100.0] (12/15), [run](evaluation/results/2026-10-09T053032_safety_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off_96810104_3aea/report.md) |

**Why two columns.** The model thinks by default. Until 2026-10-10 its
thinking counted against the 512-token output cap the app gives the SQL
answer, and when the thinking used the whole cap no SQL came back. The app and
the harness now turn thinking off (`docs/3_decisions.md`, 2026-10-10). On the
two small suites above the change moves one case each way, inside the
intervals. On the 200-case Spider and BIRD subsets it raised EX by 8.5 to 11.5
points, paired on the same cases with every interval above zero, and cut the
mean time per case from about 25 s to 3-7 s.

On `safety` with thinking off, the model refused all six data-modification
requests and declined the three internals requests as "unanswerable" rather
than refusing them (reported separately, not counted as correct). It declined
five of the six questions about data the schema does not hold, and answered
the sixth with a substitute metric.

**Spider and BIRD.** Full dev-set release runs, same model and settings,
thinking off, on commit `7708295`. EX here is this contract's typed comparison
of result sets, so it is not directly comparable with leaderboard figures
computed by each benchmark's own scorer.

| Benchmark (dev set) | Questions | EX | EX by difficulty | Run |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| Spider 1.0 | 1,034 | **64.6%** [61.6, 67.5] | easy 84.3, medium 65.9, hard 58.6, extra 38.0 | [report](evaluation/results/2026-10-10T071608_spider_dev_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off-think-off_a8ebee81_e6c2/report.md) |
| BIRD, with evidence hints | 1,534 | **35.2%** [32.9, 37.6] | simple 43.1, moderate 29.1, challenging 17.3 | [report](evaluation/results/2026-10-10T080619_bird_dev_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-on-think-off_22491cc9_3ef9/report.md) |
| BIRD, without evidence hints | 1,534 | **25.1%** [22.9, 27.3] | simple 34.2, moderate 16.3, challenging 8.2 | [report](evaluation/results/2026-10-10T104806_bird_dev_full_ollama_qwen3.5-9b-q4_K_M_rag-on-k6-evidence-off-think-off_886c714f_c734/report.md) |

Paired on the same questions, BIRD's evidence hints add 10.1 points [8.1,
12.1]. Against the earlier full Spider run at the model's default thinking,
thinking off adds 8.5 points [5.8, 11.3]. No run had an outage or an empty
answer. Mean time per question was 2.9 s on Spider and 6.2 s on BIRD.

The routine 200-case verification runs are committed as harness evidence,

> **Provenance.** The gold baseline below was last re-run on **2026-10-08** at the

> The three LLM tables are a **point-in-time record from 2026-05-19**

Evaluation was run against the 12-case benchmark in `evaluation/cases.json`.
The gold SQL baseline passed all cases, confirming that the benchmark queries and SQLite databases are valid:

```bash
python3 scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode gold
```

| Baseline | Cases | Exact Result Match |
|---|---:|---:|
| Gold SQL | 12 | 12/12 |

**2026-05-19, commit `3e5aba1` — pre-refactor pipeline.** Gemini was evaluated with `gemini-2.5-flash` and 10 configured API keys for quota failover:

```bash
python3 scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider gemini --model gemini-2.5-flash --max-cases 12 --max-retries 1 --retry-base-seconds 5
```

| Model | Safe SQL | Execution Success | Value Match, all cases | Value Match, executed only | Row Match | Exact Result Match | Avg Latency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | 12/12 | 12/12 | 11/12 | 11/12 | 6/12 | 0/12 | 3.28s |

Earlier single-key Gemini testing hit `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` on 3 cases. After enabling the multi-key manager, the same 12-case run completed with 0 quota errors.

**2026-05-19, commit `3e5aba1` — pre-refactor pipeline.** The same benchmark was also run with local Ollama models:

```bash
python3 scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider ollama --model llama3:latest --resume
python3 scripts/evaluate_text_to_sql.py --mode llm --provider ollama --model gemma4:latest --resume
```

| Model | Safe SQL | Execution Success | Value Match, all cases | Value Match, executed only | Row Match | Exact Result Match | Avg Latency |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `llama3:latest` | 12/12 | 12/12 | 8/12 | 8/12 | 5/12 | 0/12 | 3.78s |
| `gemma4:latest` | 10/12 | 10/12 | 8/12 | 8/10 | 3/12 | 0/12 | 5.65s |

Manual inspection showed that `exact_result_match` is intentionally strict. It requires matching result values, row order, and column names. Many exact-match failures were still analytically useful because the generated SQL returned the same values with different aliases, missing `ROUND()` formatting, or a different row order.

`Value Match, all cases` is the best headline metric for end-to-end reliability because blocked or failed SQL still counts against the model. `Value Match, executed only` is useful for judging SQL quality after the safety/execution layer has accepted the query. Under that second view, Gemma 4 reached 8/10, while Llama 3 reached 8/12.

For `llama3:latest`, 8 of 12 cases were value-correct. The 4 incorrect cases were:

- `retail_revenue_by_region`: ignored `discount_pct`, so completed revenue was too high.
- `retail_revenue_by_category`: ignored `discount_pct`, so completed revenue was too high.
- `retail_support_satisfaction_by_priority`: returned one overall average instead of grouping by priority.
- `healthcare_treatment_cost_by_city`: used an incorrect join/subquery and produced wrong city averages.

For `gemma4:latest`, 8 of 12 cases were value-correct. The 4 incorrect cases were:

- `university_average_score_by_course`: omitted `course_code`, changing the expected result shape.
- `retail_revenue_by_region`: generated an empty or blocked query.
- `retail_revenue_by_category`: generated truncated SQL that was blocked by the safety layer.
- `retail_support_satisfaction_by_priority`: grouped by priority but did not return the priority column.

Based on this run, the local-model choice depends on what we optimize for:

- `llama3:latest` is the stronger default for end-to-end reliability: it produced safe, executable SQL for every case, matched 8/12 values overall, and had lower average latency.
- `gemma4:latest` looks stronger among the queries it successfully executed: 8/10 executed queries were value-correct. However, it had two blocked SQL outputs on harder retail revenue questions, so its end-to-end value match remained 8/12.

For the deployed app, `llama3:latest` is the safer local default. For experimentation, Gemma 4 is worth revisiting after prompt or repair improvements because its accepted queries had a higher value-correct rate.

## Streamlit Community Cloud

For hosted deployment, use:

- Repository: `tuannm3812/text-to-sql-agent`
- Branch: `tuannm3812/main-refinement`
- Main file path: `app.py`
- Secrets: add `GEMINI_API_KEY`

See `docs/5_deployment.md` for the full checklist. Ollama is best treated as a local/offline demo option because Streamlit Community Cloud will not have access to your local Ollama server.

## Notes

This is still an MVP. The most important next improvements are persistent (model-based, not hashed) embedding retrieval for schema RAG, multi-attempt query repair instead of a single retry, and chart types beyond a bar chart (e.g. time series line charts) for result shapes the auto-chart heuristic doesn't cover yet.
